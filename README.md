# Sinking-Ship
The project consists of three scenes. The first scene just shows the ship, which is stable and not moving. The second scene will be of the moving ship. In addition, the third scene will be of the ship that is being hit onto an iceberg and sink in the sea. User interaction is provided by enabling the user to move the ship in forward and backward direction using alphabetical keys or the special keys. User can stop the ship and even change the mode to day or night. Additionally, the user can access these functions from the menu by right clicking the mouse. The objects are drawn using GLUT functions.
